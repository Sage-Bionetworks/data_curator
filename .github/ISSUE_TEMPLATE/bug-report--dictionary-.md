**Describe the issue with the metadata**
A clear and concise description of what the issue is. Changing terminology requires remapping all existing data to new terms, and may break downstream code and queries that folks use to retrieve data. Therefore, this change must be well-justified. 

**List alternative**
Using [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) or a similar resource, please find a standard term that fits your needs. OLS-listed NCIT and OBI dictionaries are preferred sources. Non-OLS sources of ground truth for specific items such as ONCOTREE for cancer types, or GEO for platform definitions are also appropriate.
