**List the new value**
Using [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) or a similar resource, please find a standard term that fits your needs. OLS-listed NCIT and OBI dictionaries are preferred sources. Non-OLS sources of ground truth for specific items such as ONCOTREE for cancer types, or GEO for platform definitions are also appropriate. 

**Provide definition of the new value**
Provide a definition and link to source. 

**Are there similar but not-quite-right values?**
Please list if applicable.
